        <h2>Ways to support</h2>
        <p>Support Acme Outdoors. COVID-19 has forced us to close our retail space, but we need support from patrons
            like yourself now more than ever. Below, we’ve listed the best ways to help us through this season.</p>
        <div class="support-block">
            <h3>SHOP PRODUCTS</h3>
            <div class="decoration-circle"></div>
            <p>Our full product line is still available online here on our site! Getting outside and hiking is still
                something you can do. Get your gear now!</p>

        <div class="support-block">
            <h3>DONATE</h3>
            <div class="decoration-triangle"></div>

                working. Donate to keep them afloat.</p>

        <h2>Shop Local.</h2>
        <p>We know that during COVID-19, a lot of folks around the city and state are feeling uneasy about the future -
            we’re not sure what the future holds either.</p>
        <p>That said: we know that we love making sure you have the gear you need for your adventures, and we’re going
            to keep doing that - with our team - until the city tells us we can’t.</p>
        <p>But as long as folks like yourself support small businesses around the city, then we’ll be here — every day,
            making sure your orders arrive on time.</p>
